# responsive-scrimba-module5
This is the responsive (faux) blog site we created in Module 5 of Scrimba's Front End Developer Career Course. By "faux blog site" I mean it's not a working blog site. Just the design. There's no JavaScript involved here. It's purely HTML and CSS.

This module is taught by Kevin Powell.
